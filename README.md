# PokeTrainer-Flask
This is a python/flask exercice, i got the idea from https://www.pokemongofriendcodes.com/, it uses python,flask, MySql.
This is itended as a execice to learn how to communicate with a MySQL DB with python and flask.
Front end is not important for this project, it is a backend exercice so i didn't give too much attention to it




Libraries needed:
Flask==0.12.2       
Flask-MySQLdb==0.2.0
